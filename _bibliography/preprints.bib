  abstract={This paper is a reply to "On Statistical Criteria of Algorithmic Fairness," by Brian Hedden. We question the significance of arguing that many group fairness criteria discussed in the machine learning literature are not necessary conditions for the fairness of predictions or decisions based on them. We show that it may be true, in general, that F is not a necessary condition for the fairness of all predictions (or decisions based on them). And yet, compatibly with this, most predictions or decisions involving people could be unfair if they violate the statistical fairness constraint F.}

  title={Discrimination for the Sake of Fairness: Fairness by Design and Its Legal Framework},
  author={Hoch, Holly and Hertweck, Corinna and Loi, Michele and Tam{\`o}, Aurelia},

  abstract={As algorithms are increasingly enlisted to make critical determinations about human actors, the more frequently we see these algorithms appear in sensational headlines crying foul on discrimination. There is broad consensus among computer scientists working on this issue that such discrimination can only be avoided by intentionally collecting and consciously using sensitive information about demographic features like sex, gender, race, religion etc. Companies implementing such algorithms might, however, be wary of allowing algorithms access to such data as they fear legal repercussions, as the promoted standard has been to omit protected attributes, otherwise dubbed “fairness through unawareness”. This paper asks whether such wariness is justified in light of EU data protection and anti-discrimination laws. In order to answer this question, we introduce a specific case and analyze how EU law might apply when an algorithm accesses sensitive information to make fairer predictions. We review whether such measures constitute discrimination, and for who, arriving at different conclusions based on how we define the harm of discrimination and the groups we compare. Finding that several legal claims could arise regarding the use of sensitive information, we ultimately conclude that the proffered fairness measures would be considered a positive (or affirmative) action under EU law. As such, the appropriate use of sensitive information in order to increase the fairness of an algorithm is a positive action, and not per se prohibited by EU law.}
