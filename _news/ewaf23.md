I'm excited that there will be a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ewaf23/" target="_blank">2nd European Workshop on Algorithmic Fairness (EWAF)</a> and that I'll be one of the general chairs. Our goal is to foster the growing European algorithmic fairness community. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ewaf23/call-for-papers" target="_blank">You can find our Call for Papers here.</a> You can submit both full papers as well as extended abstracts.
