Happy to share that our paper "What's Distributive Justice Got to Do with It? Rethinking Algorithmic Fairness from a Perspective of Approximate Justice", which I wrote with Michele Loi and Christoph Heitz, was accepted to this year's <a href="https://www.aies-conference.com/2024/">AIES</a>. The paper explores the relationship between algorithmic fairness and distributive justice.
