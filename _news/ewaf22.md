I'm proud to have been one of the organizers of the first <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ewaf22/" target="_blank">European Workshop on Algorithmic Fairness (EWAF'22)</a> held on June 8 and 9, 2022. 48 researchers gathered in Zurich to discuss algorithmic fairness. Thanks to everyone for their enthusiasm in growing the European algorithmic fairness community!
