Hi there! I'm Corinna, a PhD student in computer science at the University of Zurich and Zurich University of Applied Sciences, co-advised by <a href="http://ancsahannak.me/" target="_blank">Aniko Hannak</a> and <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/heit/" target="_blank">Christoph Heitz</a>. At the University of Zurich, I'm part of the <a href="https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/scg.html" target="_blank">Social Computing Group</a>. At the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, I'm part of the SNSF-funded project <a href="https://fair-ai.ch/" target="_blank">"Socially acceptable and fair AI"</a>.

I'm broadly interested in AI ethics and the intersection of computer science, philosophy and sociology. My work focuses on questions such as "How can technology be used to reduce social inequalities instead of exacerbating them?" and "How can we evaluate biases in decision-making systems?"

On weekends, there's a good chance you'll find me in the mountains, probably taking yet another picture of cows üêÆ
